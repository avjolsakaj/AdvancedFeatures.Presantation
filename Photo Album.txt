Photo Album - Practice Exercises C#

Requirements:
Create a class "PhotoAlbum" with attributes "nrPages", "name".

It should also have a public method "GetNumberOfPages", which will return the number of pages.

The default constructor will create an album with 16 pages, with name "Album".
There will be an additional constructor, with which we can specify the number of pages, and name of album.

Create a class "BigPhotoAlbum" whose constructor will create an album with 64 pages, and name we can specify on calling.
